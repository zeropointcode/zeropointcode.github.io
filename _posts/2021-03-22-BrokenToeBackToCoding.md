title: Broke My Toe and Resumed Coding
subtitle: Cycles of Life
---

  Last year I was in the process of learning how to code using Python after sort of learning how to use Git.
  Something happened along the way, where I became addicted to playing video games, working out and doing martial arts.
  In retrospect, I have mentally checked out from learning a new skill after hitting multiple learning road bumps.

  Fast forward almost a year. I become the strongest and most conditioned self physically. In preparation for an unsanctioned backyard fighting organization
  called StreetBeefs, I suffer from an accident that results in a broken toe. My 3rd Toe on the right foot underwent what is known as green twig fracture. Solution to my problem? Surgery, requiring an insertion of a metal pin to realign my displacement.

  This injury, one of many that I encountered on my martial arts journey made me realize a few things. First: In this industry, you make a living with your body, when the body is injured beyond function, you cease the ability to work. Second: Almost all of the top athletes in the sport hold 2nd jobs, sometimes full time. 3rd: I could of had a mental outlet/skill to fight of my boredom if I knew, how to code.

  For a while I thought that this is just another set back and I must find a way around to training. Upper body was always my weakest part of the body and now it gets all of the attention. Most interesting part to our problems is usually not what has happened, but why it has happened? It has happened for this specific reason, to reflect and visualize the direction that I am headed.

  I want to learn how to code.

  Funny how this works. I totally forgot how to use GIT. Which means, we are starting from the beginning. All over again.

  Heres an Xray of my poor toe
