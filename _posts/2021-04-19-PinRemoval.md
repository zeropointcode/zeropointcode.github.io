It's been almost 6 weeks since I've broken my toe. Unfortunately my poor fella required to have a pin inserted in order to allow the healing to take place.
Surprisingly the surgery itself was quick. Post operation, I was allowed to go back home with my girlfriend but due to nerve block, walking was very difficult.
If you can imagine a dog attempting to walk for the first time wearing rain booties, that's exactly how I looked. Knee down, completely numb, stepping on my foot felt very weird.

One doesn't realize how much we actually use our toes until you're unable to step on them. Front of my shin, knee, hip and lower back started developing issues almost within 2 days, all due to inability to use full range of ankle mobility. This lasted for 4 weeks.

3 weeks into recovery, I accidentally stubbed my foot against a box and bent the k-wire in my foot. The top of the pin was pressing into my toe and started to cause pain. This was the only instance that I actually had to take ibuprofen to alleviate the pain. Fortunately that only lasted a week before the doctor pulled out the k-wire.

Almost immediately post removal of the metal wire(surprisingly didn't hurt), I felt immediate relief in my ability to walk. Amount of gratitude I experience towards my ability to walk semi-normally right now is undeniable. It's as if God himself is petting me on the head.

During this time, I completed 4 weeks of " Russian Fighter Pull Up Program" and increased my max amount of pull ups by 100% percent. Pre operation, I was able to do 6 pull ups, now I max out at 12. I also played around with GIT, I must have deleted all my files at least 10 times. My inability to understand css, html and bootstrap resulted in fatal errors when copying and editing bootstrap templates. The fact that this website is still up and running is a miracle.

I will keep you guys updated when I get the green light to remove bandages from my poor toe. For now, enjoy this picture of the xray where I start to resemble wolverine from X-men but in my foot....
