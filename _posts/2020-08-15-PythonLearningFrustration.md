  It's been over a month since I started this journey towards web development.
I've learned how to modify static templates in order to create a website like this.
Creation would be an overstatement as I actually don't know any of the languages that are used to create this template. I have learned how to use [**Markdown**,](https://markdowntutorial.com/) in order to create posts like this. Learning basic git commands was also very fun, primarily because the terminal made me feel like a true l33t coder. I also realized that people who create GUI, are angels.

My mentor was pleased with my ability to follow novice instructions. So he appointed me with a new task to learn coding with Python. He recommended that I start with [Automating Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/)


Although the first chapter seems to be have an easy flow going. I've been unable to retain information in the next two chapters. I've been taking notes and reading extra materials online whenever I stumbled upon a term I couldn't understand. This dramatically lengthened the learning process. Honestly, the lack of comprehensive capability on my end kind of discouraging.Perhaps because I'm expecting results much faster.I'm not sure if this book really is noob friendly considering that problems you are asked to solve aren't taught prior to that request. Hopefully, I achieve a breakthrough soon, because for now, my brain feels like its thermal throttling attempting to comprehend Python.

This is what it feels like learning Python using [Automating Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/)
